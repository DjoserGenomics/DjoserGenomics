# Djoser Genomics 🧬

**"Climbing the Bioinformatics Pyramid, One Step at a Time"**

Welcome to **Djoser Genomics**, an independent initiative started by Nourelden Rihan to document and share a learning journey through the world of bioinformatics and computational biology, with a focus on transcriptomics and gene expression analysis.

Named after the iconic Step Pyramid of Djoser in Egypt, this project represents steady, step by step progress in mastering scientific tools and thinking. From Transcriptomics to Genomics, each step is another stone laid.

### 🔄 Current Focus

* RNA-seq Reanalysis & Differential Expression
* Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG & GSEA Enrichment
* Microbial Transcriptomics Projects
* Human Disease-Focused Case Studies

### 🌐 Website & Socials
