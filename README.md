## 𓀮 Who We Are
**Djoser Genomics** is an Ancient Egyptian Themed research initiative.

Focusing on Medical Bioinformatics, Synthetic Biology, and their intersections.

We follow a "Build in Public" approach, openly sharing our projects, workflows, and code to showcase our progress and invite collaboration.

Named after King Djoser, the builder of the first Step Pyramid, we believe great legacies are built one stone at a time.

## 𓏜 Active Protocols

### 🧬 [Project Menhed](https://djosergenomics.github.io/Introducing-Project-Menhed/)
**Status:** `Active` | **Focus:** `Metabolic Engineering`

Our flagship initiative. We are attempting to engineer *E. coli* (iML1515) to produce **Lycopene** at commercial yields using only open-source tools and a laptop.

* **The Goal:** Optimize Metabolic Flux for High-Yield production.
* **The Reality:** Fighting solver crashes, exploring Growth Coupling, and pivoting to Two-Stage Fermentation.
* **Latest Log:** [The Math Won (For Now)](https://djosergenomics.github.io/Project-Menhed-Update-1-The-Math-Won-For-Now/)
